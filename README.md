# 12 Days of Eloquent

Playing with laravel eloquent while singing a holiday song.

> One the first day of Eloquent
> My framework gave to me ...

> A partridge in a pear tree!
> Two turtle doves,
> Three French hens,
> Four calling birds,
> Five golden rings,
> Six geese a-laying,
> Seven swans a-swimming,
> Eight maids a-milking,
> Nine ladies dancing,
> Ten lords a-leaping,
> Eleven pipers piping,
> Twelve drummers drumming,
